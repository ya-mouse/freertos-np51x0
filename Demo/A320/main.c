/*
 * Creates all the demo application tasks, then starts the scheduler.  The WEB
 * documentation provides more details of the demo application tasks.
 * 
 * Main.c also creates a task called "Check".  This only executes every three 
 * seconds but has the highest priority so is guaranteed to get processor time.  
 * Its main function is to check that all the other tasks are still operational.
 * Each task (other than the "flash" tasks) maintains a unique count that is 
 * incremented each time the task successfully completes its function.  Should 
 * any error occur within such a task the count is permanently halted.  The 
 * check task inspects the count of each task to ensure it has changed since
 * the last time the check task executed.  If all the count variables have 
 * changed all the tasks are still executing error free, and the check task
 * toggles the onboard LED.  Should any task contain an error at any time 
 * the LED toggle rate will change from 3 seconds to 500ms.
 *
 * To check the operation of the memory allocator the check task also 
 * dynamically creates a task before delaying, and deletes it again when it 
 * wakes.  If memory cannot be allocated for the new task the call to xTaskCreate
 * will fail and an error is signalled.  The dynamically created task itself
 * allocates and frees memory just to give the allocator a bit more exercise.
 *

/* 
	Changes from V2.4.2

	+ The vErrorChecks() task now dynamically creates then deletes a task each
	  cycle.  This tests the operation of the memory allocator.

	Changes from V2.5.2
		
	+ vParTestInitialise() is called during initialisation to ensure all the 
	  LED's start off.
